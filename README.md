# Dotfiles
These are my dot files or config files.

**The idea behind this repository is to save time and all the hassle of finding the write commands, online and reconfiguring everything from scratch on a server or a new machine so I created a install script with it to hard link all the dot files.**


## How to Install?
Manually: Download and extract the repo and run, bash install.sh (with sudo).

Via terminal:
```shell 
git clone https://github.com/roufsyed/dotFiles.git 
sudo bash install install.sh
```
